## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app based on my own UI designs.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
The application uses open Weather API to get upto date weather information.\
The background changes to show whether the area is hot or cold based on a pre-determined range.
## Why I built the project this way
I didn't use state management library such as Redux on purpose. For this app simple ```useState``` is sufficient. I realised that more and more projects don't use Redux since GraphQL or react-query are often used to manage data.\
My plan is to become a Full Stack Developer eventually but for now i am focusing on Front End and that is why i chose to use an existing API rather than create a custom server. I have basic Backend knowledge as well.
## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Improve on the UI
- Provide more detailed weather information.
## Available Scripts
```
$npm start
```
